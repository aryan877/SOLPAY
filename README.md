# SolPay

## Overview

SolPay is a Next.js client application that allows users to send Solana tokens from one wallet to another. The app connects to the Solana blockchain and uses a Solana wallet to facilitate the transactions.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have a Solana wallet installed, such as Phantom or Solflare. Once you have a wallet installed, follow these steps to run the app:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the app's dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the app by running `npm run dev`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect the app to your Solana wallet.
7. Enter the wallet address of the recipient and the amount of tokens you wish to send.
8. Click the "Send Tokens" button to initiate the transaction.

## Development

To contribute to the development of Solana Token Sender, follow the steps in the Getting Started section above to run the app locally. You can then make changes to the code and see the results in real-time as you develop.
